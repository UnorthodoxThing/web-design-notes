## UI Designs with Grids

ANATOMY OF A GRID
Whether simple or complex, all grids have some common parts:

Format
The format is the area in which the design is placed. In a paper book, the format is the page. On the web, the format is the size of the browser window.
Margins
Margins are the negative space between the edge of the format and the outer edge of the content.

Columns and alleys
In its the most basic form, a grid is made up of two main components: columns and alleys. Columns are the building blocks of grids. The space between columns is referred to as alleys. Together, columns and alleys take up the horizontal width of the screen.

Modules
Modules are individual units of space created from the intersection of columns and rows (i.e. the horizontal equivalents of columns). Modules are units created from the intersection of rows and columns.

FOUR TYPES OF LAYOUT GRIDS

Below are four standard layout grids:

manuscript grid,
column grid,
modular grid,
baseline grid.

Manuscript Grid

A manuscript grid (or a single-column grid, as it’s often called) is the simplest grid structure. It’s essentially a large rectangular area that takes up most of the space inside a format.

> Manuscript grids are good for continuous blocks of text. However, they aren’t limited to text; images can be used to fill the block.

Given the name, people naturally associate manuscript grids with the printed page

Multicolumn Grid

As the name suggests, a multicolumn grid has a few columns. Remember this simple rule: The more columns you create, the more flexible your grid becomes.

Column grids are useful for layouts that contain discontinuous information. When you use a multicolumn grid, it’s possible to create zones for different kind of content. For example, you can use a particular column just for an illustration..

Modular Grid

A modular grid subdivides a page both vertically and horizontally into modules. The columns and rows and the alleys between them create a matrix of cells, or modules.

Modular grids are good when you require more control over a complex layout than a column grid can offer. A modular grid provides flexible formats for pages and allows you to create a complex hierarchy. Each module in the grid can contain a small chunk of information, or adjacent modules can be combined to form blocks.

Baseline Grid

A baseline grid is an underlying structure that guides the vertical spacing in a design. It’s used primarily for horizontal alignment and for hierarchy. Similar to how you would use columns and modules as guides in your design, you can use a baseline grid to build consistency in your layout. Using this type of grid is akin to writing on a ruled piece of paper — the grid ensures that the bottom of each line of text (its baseline) aligns with the vertical spacing. This makes a baseline grid not only an excellent typographic tool, but also extremely helpful when you’re laying out elements on the page because you can quickly check whether something on the page is missing a row of space.


A grid system improves the quality of a design (functionally and aesthetically) and the efficiency of the design process in several ways:

Creates clarity and consistency
Improves design comprehension
Makes responsive
Quickens the design process
Makes the design easier to modify and reuse
Facilitates collaboration

Best Practices For Layout Grids

SELECT THE GRID YOU REALLY NEED
“How many columns?” is the first question designers ask when starting to work with a grid.

Many popular frameworks use a grid system of 12 equal-widths column. The number 12 is the most easily divisible among reasonably small numbers; it’s possible to have 12, 6, 4, 3, 2 or 1 evenly spaced columns. This gives designers tremendous flexibility over a layout.

While the 12-column grid is a popular choice among many designers, it’s not a one-size-fits-all solution.

How do you know how many columns to use?

Before deciding on the number of columns, sketch out your possible layouts. This means you’ll need to know what content will be on the screen. The content will define the grid, not the other way around. With the sketches in hand, you’ll be better informed on the number of columns you need.

> The number of columns should be defined by the content.

CONSIDER YOUR CONSTRAINTS

Know what type of device the users will be using (specifically). This means that all design decisions (including the grid) need to consider this constraint.

FRAME IMPORTANT OBJECTS

Direct the user’s attention to important elements by adding more visual weight to them.

Tip: Items that stretch across multiple columns are visually more important than items that fill only one column.

DON’T BE AFRAID TO STEP OUTSIDE THE GRID

Designers often intentionally break grid columns in order to increase visual interest or emphasize certain elements. By breaking elements out of the grid, you’ll be highlighting them because the viewer will quickly see those breaks and be drawn to them.

> If you decide to break the grid, know what you’re doing. Taking things out of columns can break the visual hierarchy and impair the user experience.

PAY ATTENTION TO BOTH HORIZONTAL AND VERTICAL SPACING
Laying out a grid requires attention to horizontal and vertical rhythms, which are equally important.

USE A BASELINE GRID TO ALIGN ELEMENTS

As mentioned, a baseline grid can be used for horizontal alignment and hierarchy. Aligning UI design elements (text, images and content containers) to a baseline means you’ll need to make their heights a multiple of the baseline value. For example, if you choose 8 pixels as a baseline value and want to align the text, you will need to make the line height of the typeface a multiple of the baseline value, which means the **line height** could be 8, 16, 24, 32, etc. Note that the font size doesn’t have to be a multiple of the baseline, only the line height.

OPTIMIZE GRIDS FOR MOBILE

Mobile grids have limited space, making a multicolumn layout not really possible. Mobile content is typically limited to one or two columns. When designing for mobile, consider using a tile layout grid, in which the column and row heights are the same. This will give a look of square tiles across the design.

Thus, when designing a grid layout, make images large enough to be recognizable yet small enough to allow more content to be seen at a time.

Test It

> To quote Josef Muller-Brockmann, “The grid system is an aid, not a guarantee. It permits a number of possible uses and each designer can look for a solution appropriate to his personal style. But one must learn how to use the grid; it is an art that requires practice.”
