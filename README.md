## UI Designs with Grids

ANATOMY OF A GRID
Whether simple or complex, all grids have some common parts:

Format
The format is the area in which the design is placed. In a paper book, the format is the page. On the web, the format is the size of the browser window.
Margins
Margins are the negative space between the edge of the format and the outer edge of the content.

Columns and alleys
In its the most basic form, a grid is made up of two main components: columns and alleys. Columns are the building blocks of grids. The space between columns is referred to as alleys. Together, columns and alleys take up the horizontal width of the screen.

Modules
Modules are individual units of space created from the intersection of columns and rows (i.e. the horizontal equivalents of columns). Modules are units created from the intersection of rows and columns.

### FOUR TYPES OF LAYOUT GRIDS

Below are four standard layout grids:

manuscript grid,
column grid,
modular grid,
baseline grid.

Manuscript Grid

A manuscript grid (or a single-column grid, as it’s often called) is the simplest grid structure. It’s essentially a large rectangular area that takes up most of the space inside a format.

> Manuscript grids are good for continuous blocks of text. However, they aren’t limited to text; images can be used to fill the block.

Given the name, people naturally associate manuscript grids with the printed page

#### Multicolumn Grid

As the name suggests, a multicolumn grid has a few columns. Remember this simple rule: The more columns you create, the more flexible your grid becomes.

Column grids are useful for layouts that contain discontinuous information. When you use a multicolumn grid, it’s possible to create zones for different kind of content. For example, you can use a particular column just for an illustration..

Modular Grid

A modular grid subdivides a page both vertically and horizontally into modules. The columns and rows and the alleys between them create a matrix of cells, or modules.

Modular grids are good when you require more control over a complex layout than a column grid can offer. A modular grid provides flexible formats for pages and allows you to create a complex hierarchy. Each module in the grid can contain a small chunk of information, or adjacent modules can be combined to form blocks.

#### Baseline Grid

A baseline grid is an underlying structure that guides the vertical spacing in a design. It’s used primarily for horizontal alignment and for hierarchy. Similar to how you would use columns and modules as guides in your design, you can use a baseline grid to build consistency in your layout. Using this type of grid is akin to writing on a ruled piece of paper — the grid ensures that the bottom of each line of text (its baseline) aligns with the vertical spacing. This makes a baseline grid not only an excellent typographic tool, but also extremely helpful when you’re laying out elements on the page because you can quickly check whether something on the page is missing a row of space.


A grid system improves the quality of a design (functionally and aesthetically) and the efficiency of the design process in several ways:

Creates clarity and consistency
Improves design comprehension
Makes responsive
Quickens the design process
Makes the design easier to modify and reuse
Facilitates collaboration

> GRIDS ARE A FUNDAMENTAL PART OF STYLE GUIDES

### Best Practices For Layout Grids

#### SELECT THE GRID YOU REALLY NEED
“How many columns?” is the first question designers ask when starting to work with a grid.

Many popular frameworks use a grid system of 12 equal-widths column. The number 12 is the most easily divisible among reasonably small numbers; it’s possible to have 12, 6, 4, 3, 2 or 1 evenly spaced columns. This gives designers tremendous flexibility over a layout.

While the 12-column grid is a popular choice among many designers, it’s not a one-size-fits-all solution.

How do you know how many columns to use?

Before deciding on the number of columns, sketch out your possible layouts. This means you’ll need to know what content will be on the screen. The content will define the grid, not the other way around. With the sketches in hand, you’ll be better informed on the number of columns you need.

> The number of columns should be defined by the content.

### CONSIDER YOUR CONSTRAINTS

Know what type of device the users will be using (specifically). This means that all design decisions (including the grid) need to consider this constraint.

#### FRAME IMPORTANT OBJECTS

Direct the user’s attention to important elements by adding more visual weight to them.

Tip: Items that stretch across multiple columns are visually more important than items that fill only one column.

DON’T BE AFRAID TO STEP OUTSIDE THE GRID

Designers often intentionally break grid columns in order to increase visual interest or emphasize certain elements. By breaking elements out of the grid, you’ll be highlighting them because the viewer will quickly see those breaks and be drawn to them.

> If you decide to break the grid, know what you’re doing. Taking things out of columns can break the visual hierarchy and impair the user experience.

PAY ATTENTION TO BOTH HORIZONTAL AND VERTICAL SPACING;
Laying out a grid requires attention to horizontal and vertical rhythms, which are equally important.

#### USE A BASELINE GRID TO ALIGN ELEMENTS

As mentioned, a baseline grid can be used for horizontal alignment and hierarchy. Aligning UI design elements (text, images and content containers) to a baseline means you’ll need to make their heights a multiple of the baseline value. For example, if you choose 8 pixels as a baseline value and want to align the text, you will need to make the line height of the typeface a multiple of the baseline value, which means the **line height** could be 8, 16, 24, 32, etc. Note that the font size doesn’t have to be a multiple of the baseline, only the line height.

OPTIMIZE GRIDS FOR MOBILE

Mobile grids have limited space, making a multicolumn layout not really possible. Mobile content is typically limited to one or two columns. When designing for mobile, consider using a tile layout grid, in which the column and row heights are the same. This will give a look of square tiles across the design.

Thus, when designing a grid layout, make images large enough to be recognizable yet small enough to allow more content to be seen at a time.

Test It

> To quote Josef Muller-Brockmann, “The grid system is an aid, not a guarantee. It permits a number of possible uses and each designer can look for a solution appropriate to his personal style. But one must learn how to use the grid; it is an art that requires practice.”

How to choose the right font design for your titles / headlines / logo to match your brand identity

> The type of font design you pick says a lot about you, your business, and what your website is all about.

Font Designs and what do they mean?

Case Study: How to pick font designs to improve your headlines / logos

You probably want to appear responsible, trustworthy, progressive and modern because millennials probably are not looking for old-school financial planners that their parents used.

Instead, you want to project the feeling or perception that you can connect with younger, wealthier clients – your ideal target market.

So, how do you pick a font design that reflects those characteristics?

Responsible & Trustworthy: You want to choose fonts that have a traditional heritage like Trajan or Times New Roman that give off a sense of history (in the upper left side of the infographic image above).
Progressive & Modern: You want to choose a font with clean lines with a thinner weight that have a minimalistic design. This gives off a sense of modernism and progressiveness (see the fonts in the right-hand side of the infographic above).

4 Tips to picking the right font design

1. Pick a font that actually matches your message or brand identity

A font design might look nice, but if it doesn’t fit the purpose, scrap it!

There are 5 main types of personalities when it comes to font designs. Consider which personality you want to represent your website or business:

Font Personality #1) Traditional, Respectable, Comfort, Reliable:

the fonts you should consider should be designs that have been around for a very long time, such as Georgia, Trajan, and Times New Romans.

These fonts have traditionally been used in prints like newspapers, magazines, and books. Since most people are very familiar with these classic font designs, they instantly give off the impressions of heritage, reliability, and trust.

Font Personality #2) Contemporary, Modern, Minimalistic, Progressive:

These are fonts with very clean designs and has less handwriting qualities.

They often have either very bold or very thin profiles. These designs tend to have less personality so they appear more modern.

If you want your website to give off a more contemporary feel, then consider using this type of font design.

e.g. [60 free fonts for minimalist designs](https://www.canva.com/learn/minimalist-font/)

Font Personality #3) Strong, Stable, Defined:

These fonts are very bold and have a blocky design. The boldness of the font designs give the design substance and give off the impression of strength.

If you want to make a statement or want to appear robust, this is the type of font you should use.

e.g. [50 free headline fonts built for impact and audience engagement](https://www.canva.com/learn/headline-font/)

Font Personality #4) Romance, Elegance, Beauty, Vintage:

These are handwritten-type font designs with lots of curves. The curves are what give the designs a romantic and elegant feel.

Not all handwritten font designs are romantic, they can also be quirky and free-spirited. The more italic and curvy the font design, the more vintage it will look. The rounder the font design, the more quirky and retro it will appear to be.

e.g. [60 free calligraphy fonts to bring charm to your designs](https://www.canva.com/learn/calligraphy-fonts/)

Font Personality #5) Themed Font Design

These are font designs that don’t fall into any specific category because they are so stylized.  They have various characteristics and so it’s hard to cover all of them.

These font designs are handy if you want to create a unique brand identity. It will require more design skills to pick out the right design since all of them are very specialized.

e.g. [50 free stylish fonts to bring a touch of elegance to any design](https://www.canva.com/learn/stylish-fonts/)

2. Pick a font design that matches the type of audience or customer you want to attract

Ask yourself probing questions to identify the perfect audience or customers you want to attract.  Some questions include:

What is the ideal age group?
What is the preferred gender?
What profession is he/she in?
Does he/she have more/less disposable income?
These sort of questions will help you understand who you are trying to attract with your brand.

3.  Is the font design easily readable?

Never give up readability for design!

If you can’t read the text with a quick glance, scrap it!

4. Choose a font that is versatile

You will be using the same font(s) throughout your website, and your website could be viewed on different devices with different screen sizes.

You want the font design to look good regardless of its size, weight or style.

When you are picking your font, ask yourself these questions:

Does it look good in different weight like bold, italics or normal?
Does it look good in various sizes?

## 7 “deadly sins” to avoid when choosing a font style for your content [READS]

1. Don’t use tacky fonts

It might be something you want to use on your kid’s birthday party invitation, but tacky and funky fonts have no place on any websites that want to be taken seriously.

e.g. Hobo, Comic sans, Papyrus

While these tacky fonts have its place in fun and hobby-like websites (straight from the 90’s), please don’t use them on your website if you want to look professional.

2. Don’t use messy fonts that’s hard to read

Picking a font design for your main content is very different than choosing a font for your title / headline / logo.

> Don’t complicate things with stylized font designs that can be hard to read.

3.  Not giving your lines enough space

One of the easiest ways to make your content easier to read is to add enough spacing between each line.

The magic number of a perfect line-height is 150% of the font size you are using.

For example, if you are using 24px font size, the line-height will be 36px (which is 150% of 24px).

        Recommended `line-height` 1.5-2 * of font size


4. Don’t use too many different font designs

Less is always more when it come to design.

You want to keep the number of font designs on your website to no more than 4.

1 font style for Headline or Page Title

1 font style for Subtitles (optional – this is not a must. You can always use the same font style for your subtitle and body content. You can simply change the font size for the subtitle for it to stand out more)

1 font style for body content areas

1 font style for quotes

Too many styles of fonts can make your website look messy and unprofessional. People might have a hard time figuring out what are the important messages you are trying to communicate.

5. Don’t use too many font colors

Color is a powerful branding tool.

When you are choosing color(s) for your fonts, only pick 1 or 2 brand colors that truly represent you or your business to use in your headline or sub-headlines.

6. Don’t randomly pick font sizes

What are modular scaled font sizes?

It is a series of harmonious font sizes that have the perfect proportion that the general public view as “beautiful.”

> We are drawn to things that are beautiful and most beautiful things have perfect proportions. Believe it or not, this goes the same for font sizes!

So instead of guessing what font size you should use, why not just do yourself a favor and use the following sizes that are said to have the perfect proportion based on some mathematical model.

**Recommended Font Sizes**: 8, 16, 24, 32, 48, 64, 95

16px is the ideal font size for your main body text. It is not too small or too big, so it really helps improve your paragraph’s readability.

In fact, the font size we use in the main content areas of our articles is 16px.

7.  Not enough white space

Jamming too much content without any adequate breathing space on your pages can leave your visitors feeling overwhelmed as they have to focus extra hard to absorb the information.

Solution:

Pretty simple – just make sure you leave more white space between your paragraphs and between different content on your pages.

How does white space help improve your website?

1) White space helps make your website look more sophisticated and elegant

2) White space helps people focus on important information

3) White space puts less stress on the eyes so your visitors will read more & stay longer on your pages

> Using more white space is a simple technique to instantly improve your visitors’ user experience on your website.

Go through each of your pages and think about where you can add a bit more space. Also, try sitting further away from your computer screen – this can help you spot any unnecessary clutter on your page as well.

## How to Choose a Good Color Scheme For Your Website

Choose the right dominant color for your website and brand.
Combine complementary colors to create your perfect color scheme.
Choose a background color that works for you.
Use color in the correct places on your website – like a pro.

3 steps to using color on your website – the right way
There are 3 main colors you need to consider when you are designing your website:

1. Choosing a dominant color as your brand color
2. Choosing 1 to 2 accent colors to create a color scheme for your website
3. Choosing a background color to complete your design

1. Choosing a dominant color as your brand color

Different colors have the abilities to attract specific types of shoppers, and can even alter consumer behaviors.

The Differences Between Guys & Girls – Their Color Preferences

By using color combinations that are favored by either male, female, or both, you can alter their perceptions of your brand – subconsciously.

For instance, based on studies, you can see that both men and women like blue and green.  Both genders also dislike orange and brown.  So if you are targeting both genders, the research says that it would be more advantageous to consider using blue or green as your dominant color .

How you use color for your brand or products / services, can also be influenced by what emotions your target audience is drawn to.  

How to use your dominant color on your website

Here’s a general rule of thumb:

Only use your dominant color in a limited number of places where you want your website visitors to pay attention to, or if you want your visitors to take certain actions (such as call a phone number, fill in a contact form, sign up to a newsletter, etc).

2. Choose your accent colors

To make your design more interesting (and professional), you need accent colors to highlight attention-worthy parts of your website like quotes, buttons or subtitles.

Use color matching tools for shortcut - [Adobe color](https://color.adobe.com/create)

How to use your accent colors on your website

You can use them to highlight secondary information on your webpages.

These are content / items that are not the main focal points of your page, but you still want them to stand out.

For example, they may be the subtitle, secondary buttons, information boxes, background color, etc.

Try to limit to only 1 or 2 accent colors. If there are too many accent colors, they will create too many focal points that may confuse your visitors.

3. Choosing a background color to complete your design

You want your website visitors to feel comfortable browsing your website. You don’t want to annoy your visitors or make it challenging to absorb your content by using overly bold or bright background colors. At the same time, you don’t want your website to be so blasé that your audience’s eyes just glazed over any important things you want to say.

At the same time, you don’t want the color to be so boring that the room feels completely sterile.

Choosing a background colour is actually a lot like choosing a wall paint colour!

How to choose the right background colour?

> The background colour of your website depends on what you want your visitors to focus on.

Simply put, the colour you choose as your background colour completely depends on the purpose of your website.

Type #1 – Content Intensive Information Websites & eCommerce Websites

Usually use white or a neutral background colour. The purpose of these types of websites is to promote ideas or products.

**The focus is on the content or products, rather than the design of the website.  The background color is only a backdrop to help make the content more visible and readable.**

The best color scheme to use for information intensive and ecommerce websites is a white or light background, with bold dominant & accent colors. The bold dominant and accent colors give the website personality and focal points, while the plain background color keeps your visitors’ focus on your content or products.

Type #2 – Corporate / Business Websites

Corporate / business websites usually have two purposes — Promoting the brand or its services.

Depending on which purpose your business website wants to focus on, your background color will be different.

Promoting a Brand

When you want to build a strong brand identity, you should use various shades of your dominant or brand color as your background color.

When you use a variation of your dominant/brand color as your background, you are reinforcing your brand and makes it more memorable to your audience.

If you have a very bold brand color, using it as your background color can be too overwhelming. If that was the case, consider choosing a less intense shade of your brand color instead.

Promoting a Service

If you want the value of your service or your portfolio of past projects to be the focal point, use white or a neutral background color.

Just like content intensive and ecommerce websites, you don’t want your background color to take the focus away from your content or the message you want to communicate.

By choosing a neutral or white background, your content will naturally become more attention grabbing.

Type #3 – Stylish & Creative Websites that are Graphic Intensive

For websites used in fashion, design, restaurant, beauty and creative industries, the world is your oyster.

There are really no rules as to what background image or colors you should use. You can use a black menu bar to create more drama; Or you can use all the colors of the rainbow to create an inspirational background image.

Honestly, here you can break all the rules and use any color you like as long as you keep this 1 rule in mind — “Never choose a background that makes your text or content hard to read.“

> Your perfect background color is one that allows your content to be the focal point while working harmoniously with your dominant & accent colors, and makes your audience feel good while browsing your website.

When in doubt, use white or very light gray as your background color. While it might not be the most inspiring color, you know your content will always shine through.

Choosing the right color scheme for your website should never be based on your favorite color, or on a gut feeling.

A good website design is one that always put its audience first.

> (1) Matching your brand with the right dominant color; (2) matching the dominant color with accent colors using the Adobe tool; and finally (3) matching the background color with your dominant & accent colors.

## fonts

### Line height

The recommended `line-height` is 1.5-2 of the font. The font-size is multiplied to get the line-height

### Recommended amount of words in sentence

To determine line length for optimum readability, a good guideline is between 9 and 12 words for unjustified text. Fewer words may cause the sentence structure to break up, and may also result in too many hyphenations. Both of these reduce readability. Conversely, a line with more than 12 words can become tedious to read. Additionally, a reader can easily get lost when going from the end of one long line to the beginning of the next, and may inadvertently reread the same line, or miss a line or two.

With justified text, the number of words per line should be between 12 and 15 words per line, to avoid excessive hyphenations, uneven word spacing, and rivers of white space in the text.

Webwise: On the Web and on tablets, e-readers and other mobile devices, type size and line length are not always fixed measurements as they are in print. Appearance can vary depending on the viewer’s platform (Mac or PC), browser and version, screen resolution, default or customized preferences, as well as on how the the text is coded. Nevertheless, the principles of what constitutes effective, readable text remain the same, even when the particulars vary.

Several factors to consider when determining the width of a column of text are:

typeface (or font): The width of the individual glyphs and the overall typeface design affect the word count per line.
point size: The size of the type affects how many words fit in a line.
average word length in the copy: You can fit a greater number of shorter words than longer ones in a given column width.
